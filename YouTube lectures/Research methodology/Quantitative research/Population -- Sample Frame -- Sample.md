### Population -\> Sample Frame -\> Sample
It is usually impossible to access a population directly. For example, I don’t personally know all internet users in Kathmandu, and there is no comprehensive list compiled anywhere. If I want to study this group of people, I need a systematic way of finding them.

In this regard, you can think about the relationship between your population and your frame as being very similar similar to the relationship between your conceptual variable and your operational variable.

Conceptual vs. Operational Variables
•	If I want to quantify an abstract idea like “rice quality”, I need to come up with a set of practical, objective rules for measuring this thing. So,
◦	If my conceptual variable is “rice quality” (an abstract idea),
◦	…my operational variable might be:
▪	“% of unbroken grains in a 10kg bag” (an objective measurement)
▪	“volume of dirt/debris per cubic meter” (an objective measurement)
▪	“nutritional content of rice as assessed by a food lab” (an objective measurement)
▪	“consumer ratings of taste” (a subjective measurement for the people doing the tasting, but objective for me)
▪	I might even use some numerical combination of all these factors (an index)
As a researcher, it is my responsibility to decide how I want to measure my variable, and my choices will impact my findings in important ways.

Populations vs. Sampling Frames
•	Similarly, if I want to make observations about “women in Nepal with children aged \<36mo”, I need a systematic way of identifying them. I can’t just go out and draw a sample from my population directly because I don’t have any way of knowing who these people are or where they live. So,
◦	If my population is “women with children aged \<36mo” (a real but disaggregated group)
◦	…my frame might be:
▪	the women who have been documented by community health workers as having given birth in the last 36 months (a specific, identifiable group of people)
▪	women who recently obtained polio vaccines at regional health posts (a specific, identifiable group of people)
▪	women buying diapers at Bhatbhateni (a specific, identifiable group of people)
From any of these groups of people, I can reliably take a sample.  Which of them I choose, however, will have deep effects on my results.

In other words, in any study, your frame is the group of people that you have somehow gotten access to. You should design your frame with hopes that it will approximate your population. This process is never perfect, but some ways of doing it are inevitably going to be better than others. In more precise terms:

•	Your population is the set of people (or households, or VDCs, or countries, or anything else) you want to describe with your analysis.
•	Your frame is the set of people (or households, or VDCs, etc) who actually have a chance of becoming part of your sample.

Frames are always a subset of your population. Every person in your frame will be part of your population, but (under most circumstances) there will be members of your population who aren’t represented by your frame.

If my population is “consumers of packaged rice”, for example, I might specify a frame like “people buying rice at Bhatbhateni”. That will get me easy access to my target population, but I am systematically excluding people who obtain their rice elsewhere. I then have to ask: with this as my frame, will my sample still be “good enough”? Maybe, but maybe not. This is a fundamental question in research design.

We’ll talk about these issues more when we start getting into inferential statistics (the part of statistics that deals with sampling). Next week, we’ll be looking at probability distributions, some descriptive measures, and (most importantly!) the normal curve. See you soon!
