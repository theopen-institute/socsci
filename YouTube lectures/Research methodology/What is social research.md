### What is social research?

In today’s lecture, we’re going to talk about *social research*. What is it? Where does it come from? And how does it work?

In broad terms, “social research” is a way of asking *questions* about people and the communities they form. It is a technique — or, to be more precise, a number of different techniques — that we can use to make *knowledge* about society in scientifically rigorous ways. This is a very important thing to do. The world is an increasingly complicated place, and we need better knowledge to make better decisions about things like public policy, humanitarian crises, business planning, education, and social justice.

In general, social research begins with the observation of a problem. This can be just about anything.

- Maybe you are a community health worker tasked with improving the well-being of people in in your district. Early in your work, you start to notice that rates of suicide are tragically high, especially among youth. You’d like to propose an intervention of some sort, but what should we do? It is very easy to speculate about the causes of social problems, but it’s much harder to know whether our guesses reflect reality or just our own assumptions. A statistical analysis of the risk factors associated with suicide could be an excellent way to separate the facts from the myths.
- Or, maybe you’ve noticed that a language spoken around you doesn’t seem to fit with our current theories of grammar. By gathering samples and analyzing them carefully, you could devise new structures of analysis that offer better insight into how the human capacity for language works.
-  Or, maybe you own a business that manufactures clothing, and you want to know how to improve your sales. You could just guess what people want to buy, 
- Or, maybe you are responsible for managing the water system in a small town, and you need to decide how large of a water treatment facility you should build. It would be easy enough to just measure how much water people use now, but it would be far better if you could rigorously predict what level of demand you will need to satisfy ten, twenty, or fifty years from now.
- Or, maybe you’ve found a group of people who cooperate really well, and you want to understand how it works.

#### Topic versus methodology

Cultural anthropologists, for example, have been known to study everything from marriage ceremonies to Wall Street banking, but most of them agree that the way to study cultural phenomenon is through techniques of  *participant observation* and *ethnography*.

All social research is *empirical*. 

- So what is the difference between qualitative and quantitative research.

- First, let’s talk about what they have in common:
	- Both are *empirical* forms of research.
